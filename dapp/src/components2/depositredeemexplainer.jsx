                Deposit any ERC721 token to receive 12 newly-minted NFTs in return
                -- one for each month of the year. Each NFT has a different month
                associated with it on the Ethereum blockchain. These don't "expire"
                after a year -- you own the asset fully for the same month each year.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can always redeem the underlying asset by giving back all
                of the 12 timeshares. You must own or operate all 12 timeshares
                to get back the original NFT.
